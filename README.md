Title: Sentiment-based Word Cloud Generator (Excluding Countries and Nationalities)

Description:
The Sentiment-based Word Cloud Generator (Excluding Countries and Nationalities) is a project that analyzes and visualizes the sentiment of textual data while excluding references to countries and nationalities. By using sentiment analysis techniques, the project categorizes text into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. It then generates word clouds for each sentiment category, highlighting the most impactful words.

The project filters out mentions of countries and nationalities from the text to focus on sentiments unrelated to geographic locations and identities. This filtering ensures that the word clouds primarily capture non-geographic sentiments.

Once the sentiment categorization and filtering are complete, the project generates word clouds for each sentiment category. The word clouds visualize the most frequent and important words, providing insights into prevailing sentiments within the analyzed data.

The Sentiment-based Word Cloud Generator is designed for researchers, data analysts, and social media managers seeking to understand sentiment patterns while excluding references to countries and nationalities. By focusing on sentiments, this tool enables precise sentiment analysis and visualization of textual data, facilitating deeper insights and informed decision-making.

Note: The project implementation may involve additional steps such as data preprocessing, sentiment analysis model selection, and customization of visualization parameters based on specific requirements.
